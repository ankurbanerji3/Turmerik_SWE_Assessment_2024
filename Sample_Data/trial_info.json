        "brief_summary": "Lithium, the gold standard for treatment of Bipolar Disorder (BD) and a common augmentation to medication therapy for Major Depression, is commonly continued in pregnancy due to its therapeutic benefit and more recent data that suggests the teratogenic effects of lithium are less than historically believed. Due to the increased elimination of lithium during pregnancy, lithium concentration decreases in the blood and women with BD are vulnerable to BD episode recurrence in pregnancy. Uncontrolled symptoms of BD in pregnancy increase the risk for postpartum exacerbation of BD and psychosis. Our study will investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lithium prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy, and postpartum. Twenty women taking lithium in pregnancy or planning to become pregnant and continue lithium will be invited to participate in a study to measure repeated blood levels of lithium at six time points between preconception and 3 months postpartum. The data collected will inform the dose, timing of dose, and frequency of dosing of lithium that will lead to fewer untoward effects for the mother and baby. Change in elimination clearance of lithium will be correlated with symptom worsening to develop a dosing algorithm that will help maintain wellness for pregnant women with mood disorders.",

So far, treatment strategies focused on the preservation of life and limb by an open surgical or endovascular revascularization, together with cardiovascular risk management and pain relief. Important modifiable factors related to mortality and morbidity are not covered in the current national and international guidelines. This study investigates the effects on mobility, mortality and quality of life with supplementation of the standard treatment of critical limb ischemia with supervised exercise therapy. Also a reduction of cardiovascular risk by intensive risk factor management and lifestyle coaching will be taken in to account. The supervised exercise therapy will take place under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist.",
